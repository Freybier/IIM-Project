# IIM-Project

The actual code for this project is only located inside the "/scr" folder.
The Main is in "/scr/iim/projekt/IIMProjekt.java".

To switch between reading from a Handtuch.csv directly, to reading the table from an html file or directly from a website(untested),
you just need to either uncomment line 34-35 or uncomment line 36 and enter the valid URL from you desired website in the class IIMProjekt.java.

To start the programm you can either run it directly in an IDE or you can run the batch-file, "Execute Stundenplaner".
Or you can use the directory already sent to you via mail, where you need to execute the batch file aswell.

Please consider that the Directory sent, and this one have minimal differences because of the file paths.
That causes that you can still run this code using the IDE, but the structure of the directories need to stay as they are.

The files already sent only consist of the four mandatory files, and can be run from anywhere on your computer.

Please Note that for runnig the batch-file you need to have Java installed, a guide for that is located inside the "README.txt" in the directory previously sent.
